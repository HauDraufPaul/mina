## Overview

The System Monitor provides real-time monitoring of:

- CPU usage and performance
- Memory (RAM) usage
- Disk space and I/O
- Network traffic and connections
- Running processes
- System health metrics

## Features

### Real-time Metrics

View live updates of system metrics:

- **CPU**: Usage percentage, core count, frequency
- **Memory**: Total, used, free, and usage percentage
- **Disk**: Total, used, free space, and usage percentage
- **Network**: RX/TX bytes, speeds, and connections

### Process Management

- Monitor network traffic
- See connection states and protocols
- Track network interface statistics

## Usage

1. Navigate to **System Monitor**
2. View real-time metrics in the dashboard
3. Switch between tabs for different views:
   - **Overview**: System-wide metrics
   - **Processes**: Running processes
   - **Network**: Network connections

## Metrics Explained

### CPU Usage

Shows the percentage of CPU capacity currently in use. High usage may indicate:
- CPU-intensive applications
- Background processes
- System tasks

### Memory Usage

Displays RAM utilization. Monitor for:
- Memory leaks
- High memory consumption
- Available memory for new processes

### Disk Usage

Shows storage space utilization. Important for:
- Preventing disk full errors
- Planning storage upgrades
- Monitoring disk I/O performance

### Network Traffic

Tracks data transfer rates. Useful for:
- Identifying bandwidth usage
- Detecting network issues
- Monitoring data consumption

## Best Practices

- Monitor metrics regularly
- Set up alerts for critical thresholds
- Review process list for suspicious activity
- Track network connections for security
- Use historical data for trend analysis
